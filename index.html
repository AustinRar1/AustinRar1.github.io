    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> Life behind my computer isn't the only place I can throw myself into. Almost anything I can find interest in becomes
      nearly 100% of my focus. A trait picked up by my father, any thing that happens around our house is fixed by him, and
      most times the neighbors houses as well. These habits lead him to become a jack of all trades which I pick up on on
      subconciously. I see problems that need fixing or opportunities that could use improving and wonder why don't I just
      do that myself? I intend on taking charge and putting in all the work so that I can be apart of the solution.

      <h3>Mechanical</h3>
      <p>At 16 I fall in love with cafe racers. Cafe racers are a throwback styling to an actual aplication of weight reduction from early motorcycle racers (this being my interpretaion). Being a gear head because of my father I see an opportunity, buy and build my own cafe racer. 17 years old and I go on Ebay and look for months and months, finally I find a bike, buy it, ship it, and finally recieved it. Breaking it apart was easy, the hard part came with rebuilding it into a specific vision, long story short I took exponentially longer to put it back together, but the addiction was there and will be for a long time.</p>

    <div id="Technological" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Technological</h3>
      <p>Ever since I can remember I've had some type of gaming system, SNES, gameboy color, Playstation, etc... all of which I played constantly. As a result of constant messing with gaming systems and all of the User Interface systems I see things that can be improved. Looking into this subject I find out that all games are made as a result of coding. Sparking my interest I follow this Developer esque mindset with questioning everything In all games or any technological item I use.   </p>

    <div id="Musical" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Musical</h3>
      <p>Starting with my interest in guitar I started to listen to more jazz and jazz-hop, because of this influance and gravitation to the guitar I began to teach myself how to play. Eventually this lead me to start learning piano because of the similarities it has with guitar. Soon after I pick up the Ukulele as a result of my favorite singer songwriter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Johnson_(musician)">Jack Johnson</a>. Seemingly out of nowhere I develop a love for the sounds of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuhachi">Shakuhachi</a>, a japanese woodwind, which I slowly teach myself.</p>

    <div id="Martial Arts" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
      <p>Starting in 2003 I was finished with baseball and wanted to branch out from typical school sports. Looking for something close to home I found  <a href="http://www.adamsonkarate.com/"> Adamsons Karate</a>, located in Zionzville, IN. 8 years later in 2011 I recieved my blackbelt, with which I persue other martial arts.   </p>
